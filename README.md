# Data Structures and Algorithms

**The main purpose of this repository is to simplify the complexity of Data Structures and provide
easy-to-grasp narratives for each concept and algorithm. Codes are explained to the greatest detail
and provides an easy learning experience for programmers of all levels.**

**I have added extra algorithms such as File IO, Generics, Recursion, etc. because I personally 
believe they are also important in the world of programming.**

**Data structures is essential in the world of programming and understanding the basics is crucial.**
